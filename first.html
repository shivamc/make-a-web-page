  <h1>Introduction to the Basics of HTML</h1>
  
  <div class="stage">
    <h2>Stage One</h2>
  </div>
 
  <div class="matter">
    <b>Ingrediants of the Internet</b><br>
    1. <em>HTML</em> which stands for Hyper Text Markup Languages
    <br>
    2. Major Parts of the Web are Browser, Net, Server and HTTP which is a protocol.
    <br>
    3. <em>HTML</em> can include Text, Markups, Media and Links to other pages.
  </div>

  <div class="matter">
    <b>HTML Markup</b> <em>Tags</em>
    <br>
    Note- All tags except void tags have an opening and closing,<br> now we shall talk about various tags.
    <br>
    1. The <b>BOLD</b> tag makes the content of the text font bold.
    <br>
    2. The <em>Emphasis</em> tag makes the content of the text font Italics.
    <br>
    3. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchor">Anchor</a> Tab is according to me one of the most important tags, as it is instrumenal<br>in giving meaning to the word <b>Web</b>.
    <br>
    4. The <b>Image</b> Tag is also a very important tags, example of it mentioned here
    <div class="image-des">
      <div class="image">
        <img src="https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_400_400/p/2/000/0ba/3fb/1af8ca8.jpg" alt="too famous to feature here">
      </div>
    <b>OMG they know who I am Now!!</b>
    </div>
    <br>
    On a serious note Image tags are also an example of Void tags like Break Tab.
    <br>
    5. The White Space tags like the break tag and p tags are used to give whites spaces between <br>lines and paras.
  
  </div>

  <div class="span">
    <b>Span and Div Tags</b>
    <br>
    To be honest i did not understand Span and Div tags a lot, i only understood that the main <br>difference between the two is that Span is Inline and Div is Block.
    <br>
     <span> Spamis Inline hence non space i think ? </span>
    
    <div class="matter">Giving an Example of Div now as white space is good.</div> 
  </div>

  <div class="matter">
    <em>This is what i have understood till now, I am very excited as i know this is basic stuff but its still<br>very interesting and useful.</em>
  </div>

  <div class="stage"> 
    <h2>Stage Two</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="matter">
    <p>The learning in stage 2 have been quite informative, the ideas that i have remembered from it are mentioned below
    <br>
    HTML and CSS are both languages, wherein CSS defines the style/display of the code using developer tools we can see the tree like structure of a plage also known as DOM, All elements on a web page are diplayed in boxes</p>
  </div>

  <div class="matter"><p>
    <b>Adding CSS Style and HTML Structure</b><br>
    CSS is useful in reducing repetitions it is most important for coders not to repeat as more repetitions increases the chance of mistakes its also complaicated the structure of the documents and its very hard to find erros, the best way to use CSS is adding a link in the head tab linking to a different style sheet. We can also use Style tags for the same but this is not the preffered way. In the CSS sheet we use Selector which is used to define the element and then add the various styles to it, there are lots and lots of choices avaiable for customization.We have also learned that webpages are basically boxes and there are boxes which protect the content for the best user experience. For properly positioning the page we should use <b>Flex</b> Box in the CSS sheet there are numerable ways this can be customized like <em>Direction, Grow,Shrink</em> etc. 
    </p>
    <p>In Summary we should be looking for boxes, repeated Styles, write the HTML apply the style and then fix the style. Writing and fixing has to be done until optimal results are achieved.
